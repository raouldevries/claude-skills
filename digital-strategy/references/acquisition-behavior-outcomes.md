# Acquisition-Behavior-Outcomes Trifecta

The three-part model for comprehensive digital marketing analysis, ensuring every campaign measures the full customer journey — not just one slice.

## The Trifecta Model

Every digital marketing effort has three measurable phases:

```
Acquisition ──→ Behavior ──→ Outcomes
(How they arrived)   (What they did)   (What they produced)
```

Most campaigns measure only one phase (usually outcomes). The trifecta ensures all three are measured, revealing the complete picture and the true cause of success or failure.

## Acquisition: Measuring the "How They Arrived"

### Key Questions
- Is the traffic acquisition strategy diversified or over-reliant on one channel?
- Are we reaching the right people (quality) or just any people (quantity)?
- What is the cost of acquiring each visitor/prospect?
- How does acquisition source predict downstream behavior and outcomes?

### Healthy Acquisition Portfolio (Meta Ads Context)

| Component | Healthy Mix | Risk if Missing |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Prospecting campaigns | 60-70% of spend | No new customer growth; relying on existing audience |
| Retargeting campaigns | 15-25% of spend | Leaving money on table from warm audiences |
| Re-engagement campaigns | 5-15% of spend | Ignoring existing customer base; low LTV |
| Brand/awareness campaigns | 5-10% of spend | No top-of-funnel pipeline; eventually dries up |

### Acquisition Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Healthy Range |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| CPM | Cost efficiency of reaching people | Varies by audience; lower is not always better |
| CTR | Message-audience resonance | 1-3% for prospecting; 3-8% for retargeting |
| CPC | Cost of generating interest | Industry-dependent; trend matters more than absolute |
| New audience % | Fresh prospect penetration | 60%+ for prospecting campaigns |
| Frequency | Impression saturation risk | < 3 for prospecting; < 8 for retargeting |

## Behavior: Measuring the "What They Did"

### Key Questions
- What do visitors do after clicking an ad?
- Are they engaging with the intended content?
- How deep is their engagement (pages viewed, time spent, actions taken)?
- What behavior patterns predict conversion?

### Behavioral Signals from Meta Ads Traffic

| Signal | How to Measure | What It Indicates |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Bounce rate (from analytics) | Single-page sessions / total sessions | Ad-to-landing-page relevance |
| Scroll depth | Analytics event tracking | Content engagement quality |
| Time on site | Analytics session duration | Interest level and content match |
| Pages per session | Analytics page views | Exploration and consideration |
| Micro-conversions | Pixel events (ViewContent, AddToCart) | Progress through purchase funnel |
| Return visits | Analytics returning user rate | Consideration and intent building |

### Behavior Optimization Loop
1. Identify the expected behavior for each campaign's audience stage
2. Measure actual behavior against expectations
3. When behavior diverges, investigate: wrong audience (acquisition problem) or wrong landing page (experience problem)
4. Test fixes and re-measure

## Outcomes: Measuring the "What They Produced"

### Key Questions
- Did the campaign achieve its intended business result?
- What is the total economic value produced (macro + micro conversions)?
- How does outcome value compare to acquisition cost?
- Which segments produce the highest-value outcomes?

### Three Outcome Priorities
From Kaushik's framework, the only three outcomes that matter:

1. **More Revenue** — Direct sales, leads that convert, subscription sign-ups
2. **Reduced Cost** — Lower acquisition costs, automated processes, decreased support load
3. **Increased Customer Satisfaction** — Higher NPS, better reviews, more repeat purchases

Every KPI and metric should connect to one of these three.

### Outcome Metrics by Campaign Type

| Campaign Purpose | Primary Outcome | Secondary Outcomes |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| E-commerce prospecting | Revenue / ROAS | AOV, new customer %, first-purchase category |
| Lead generation | Qualified leads | Lead-to-customer rate, pipeline value |
| App promotion | Installs | Registration rate, Day-7 retention, in-app revenue |
| Brand awareness | Recall lift | Direct traffic increase, branded search volume |
| Customer retention | Repeat purchase rate | CLV increase, churn reduction |

## Meta Ads Application

### Applying the Trifecta to Campaign Analysis

For every campaign, measure and report all three phases:

```
Campaign: [Name]

ACQUISITION
- Reach: [number]
- CPM: [cost]
- CTR: [rate]
- New audience: [%]

BEHAVIOR
- Landing page views: [number]
- Page load rate: [clicks to LPV %]
- On-site engagement: [pages/session, time, scroll depth]
- Micro-conversions: [ViewContent, AddToCart]

OUTCOMES
- Macro conversions: [purchases/leads]
- Conversion rate: [%]
- CPA / ROAS: [cost/return]
- Total economic value: [macro + micro value]
```

### Diagnosing Issues with the Trifecta

| Symptom | Acquisition Issue? | Behavior Issue? | Outcome Issue? |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| High impressions, low clicks | Wrong audience or weak creative | — | — |
| Good CTR, high bounce | Message-page mismatch | Poor landing page | — |
| Good engagement, low conversion | — | Maybe: friction in flow | Conversion tracking issue or pricing problem |
| Good conversion, low ROAS | — | — | Low AOV or wrong value attribution |
| Good first purchase, no repeat | — | — | No retention strategy (Care stage) |

### Connecting to STDC Framework

The trifecta maps naturally to the See-Think-Do-Care framework:

| STDC Stage | Acquisition Focus | Behavior Focus | Outcome Focus |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| See | Reach, new audience % | Video views, content consumption | Ad recall, brand lift |
| Think | Engaged click rate | Product page views, comparison | Email sign-up, content download |
| Do | Conversion-optimized audiences | Add to cart, initiate checkout | Purchase, lead submission |
| Care | Existing customer reach | Repeat engagement, loyalty actions | Repeat purchase, referral |

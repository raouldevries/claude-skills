# Digital Marketing & Measurement Model (DMMM)

The five-step DMMM framework for connecting business objectives to measurable digital outcomes, based on Avinash Kaushik's structured approach to digital marketing measurement.

## Why DMMM Matters

The root cause of failure in most digital marketing campaigns is not creative quality, targeting, or budget. It is the lack of structured thinking about what the real purpose of the campaign is and objective measures to identify success or failure.

Winners have a well-structured Digital Marketing & Measurement Model before they think about data or tools. Losers don't.

## The Three Pillars

A complete DMMM must cover all three areas:

### 1. Acquisition
How are you planning to acquire traffic? Cover all three components:
- **Earned media**: Organic social shares, word of mouth, press coverage, organic search
- **Owned media**: Website, email list, social profiles, content
- **Paid media**: Meta Ads, Google Ads, sponsorships, influencer partnerships

### 2. Behavior
What behavior do you expect after people arrive?
- Pages they should see, content they should consume
- Actions they should take (sign up, add to cart, request demo)
- Repeat visit patterns, engagement depth

### 3. Outcomes
What results signify value delivered to the business?
- Purchases, qualified leads, phone calls
- Downloads, sign-ups, registrations
- Brand lift, task completion, customer satisfaction

If the DMMM doesn't cover all three pillars, it is incomplete.

## The Five Steps

### Step 1: Identify Business Objectives
**Who leads**: Senior executives
**Question**: "Why does this campaign / account / initiative exist?"

Business objectives must be **DUMB**:
- **D**oable — Realistic given resources and timeline
- **U**nderstandable — Clear to everyone in the organization
- **M**anageable — Can be broken into actionable goals
- **B**eneficial — Delivers value to the company

Typical objectives: 3-5 maximum. Too many = no focus. Too vague = no action.

### Step 2: Identify Goals for Each Objective
**Who leads**: Management + marketers, with analyst input
**Definition**: Specific strategies to accomplish each objective

Goals drill down from objectives. Each objective should have 2-4 goals.

Example:
- Objective: "Generate qualified leads for sales team"
  - Goal 1: Drive targeted traffic from ideal customer profiles
  - Goal 2: Capture contact information through valuable content offers
  - Goal 3: Collect e-newsletter registrations for nurture sequences

Goals should cover both macro conversions (primary) and micro conversions (secondary).

### Step 3: Identify Key Performance Indicators
**Who leads**: Analyst, with data team support
**Definition**: Metrics that measure progress toward objectives

For each goal, identify the most relevant KPI. Choose smart KPIs:
- Ratios over counts (conversion rate, not just conversions)
- Outcome metrics over activity metrics (revenue, not impressions)
- Segmentable metrics that reveal causes

See `metrics-kpis` skill for detailed KPI selection guidance.

### Step 4: Set Targets
**Who leads**: Management + finance
**Definition**: Numerical values pre-determined as indicators of success or failure

Every KPI needs a target. Without targets, you cannot determine if 1.2 million video views is great or awful.

Target sources:
- Historical performance (how similar efforts performed before)
- Comparable efforts (if a boring video got 30K views, a peppy one should get more)
- Finance calculations (acceptable CPA based on margin and LTV)
- Industry benchmarks (when no historical data exists)

**Pro tip**: If no target exists, make a reasonable estimate. An imperfect target is infinitely better than no target. Revise monthly with real data.

### Step 5: Identify Segments
**Who leads**: Analyst, with executive input
**Definition**: Groups of people, sources, behaviors, and outcomes to analyze

Segments prevent aimless data exploration. Pre-define which dimensions to analyze for each goal:

- Traffic sources most important to each goal
- Customer attributes (demographics, geography, device)
- Behavioral segments (new vs. returning, high engagement vs. low)
- Outcome segments (converters vs. non-converters, high value vs. average)

See `data-analysis` skill for detailed segmentation strategies.

## Meta Ads Application

### DMMM for a Meta Ads Account

| Step | Meta Ads Equivalent | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Objectives | Account strategy | Grow online revenue 25% this quarter |
| Goals | Campaign purposes | Prospecting for new customers, retargeting cart abandoners, re-engaging past buyers |
| KPIs | Campaign metrics | Prospecting: CPA < $35; Retargeting: ROAS > 5x; Re-engagement: ROAS > 3x |
| Targets | Performance benchmarks | Based on last quarter + 15% improvement |
| Segments | Breakdowns to analyze | By audience, creative, placement, device, age/gender |

### Campaign Objective → DMMM Mapping

| Campaign Objective | Typical Business Objective | KPI | Target Source |
|-------------------|--------------------------|-----|--------------|
| OUTCOME_AWARENESS | Build brand recognition in new market | Cost per 1,000 reached, ad recall lift | Industry benchmarks, brand lift study baseline |
| OUTCOME_TRAFFIC | Drive qualified visitors to evaluate product | Cost per landing page view, engaged visit rate | Historical landing page performance |
| OUTCOME_LEADS | Generate sales-qualified leads | Cost per lead, lead-to-customer rate | CRM data: historical lead value |
| OUTCOME_SALES | Generate direct online revenue | ROAS, cost per purchase | Finance: margin-based acceptable CPA |

### The DMMM as a Contract

Once completed, the DMMM serves as a measurement contract between marketing and leadership. Get it signed (figuratively) so all parties are clear on:
- What the campaign is solving for
- How success will be measured
- What good and bad performance looks like
- Where analysis will focus

This prevents the common failure mode: launching campaigns, collecting data, and then debating what "success" means after the fact.

### Quarterly DMMM Review

Kill 25% of metrics each year. The business, its priorities, and its marketing strategies change constantly. Review and update the DMMM quarterly:

- Are objectives still aligned with business priorities?
- Do goals reflect current strategy (not last quarter's)?
- Are KPIs still the right measures of success?
- Do targets reflect current reality (seasonality, competition, budget)?
- Are segments still relevant (new audiences, channels, products)?
